# Vim

As of July 2024, I mostly use Neovim (configured in config/nvim) rather than vim.

However, Vim is still great and so I keep the config around.

## Packages

Vim packages are installed as git submodules under `vim/pack/<username>/start/<package>`:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/username/package.git vim/pack/username/start/package
```
